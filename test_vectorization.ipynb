on age thy mouth was mute thy face was hidden and the lips and eyes that loved thee blind and dumb song forsook their tongues that held thy name forbidden light their eyes that saw the strange gods kingdom come fire for light and hell for heaven and psalms for pæans filled the clearest eyes and lips most sweet of song when for chant of greeks the wail of galileans made the whole world moan with hymns of wrath and wrong yea not yet we see thee father as they saw thee they that worshipped when the world was theirs and thine they whose words had power by thine own power to draw thee down from

heaven upon her till the word was clothed with speech by lips of man and the word and the life wast thou the spirit of man and the breath and before thee the gods that bow take life at thine hands and

of man the worlds whole story not of morning and of evening is thy day old and younger gods are buried or begotten from uprising to downsetting of thy sun risen from eastward fallen to westward and forgotten and their springs are many but their end is one divers births of godheads find one death appointed as the soul whence each was born makes room for each god by god goes out discrowned and disanointed but the soul stands fast that gave them shape and speech is the sun yet cast out of heaven is the song yet cast out of man life that had song for its leaven to quicken the blood that ran

the stars whose fires grow dark in thy sight shine as sunbeams on the night of death and sin time again is risen with mightier word of warning change hath blown again a blast of louder breath clothed with clouds and stars and dreams that melt in morning lo the gods that ruled by grace of sin and death they are conquered they break they are stricken whose might made the whole world pale they are dust that shall rise not or quicken though the world for their deaths sake wail as a hound on a wild beasts trace so time has their godhead in chase as wolves when the hunt makes head they are
